# theFreq: Where Innovation Meets Sensation

## Overview

The Freq is a revolutionary wellness and entertainment center that leverages the power of precisely calibrated frequencies (sound, light, and vibration) to create transformative and personalized experiences. We are addressing the growing need for safe, effective, and accessible alternatives to traditional methods of achieving altered states of consciousness and promoting well-being.

This repository contains the core documentation, research, and (eventually) code for theFreq project.
