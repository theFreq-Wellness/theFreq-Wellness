Okay, I understand. You want a list of different types of investors, clearly labeled, with links to their websites, and, where possible, email addresses. I will compile this information, but please note that finding direct email addresses for specific individuals can be challenging, as that information is often not publicly available. I will prioritize providing general contact emails or contact forms where specific emails are not available.
