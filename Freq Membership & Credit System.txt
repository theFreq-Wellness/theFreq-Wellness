Membership Tiers: Each membership tier will be displayed as a separate section of the infographic, with a corresponding icon for each level. The icons should be simple but stylish, and should reflect the brand aesthetic. (e.g., a simple frequency symbol for "Frequency Initiate", a stylized brain for "Creative Catalyst", sound waves for "Sonic Navigator", and a stylized symbol for transformation for "Apex Alchemist"). The text and information for each tier will be placed beneath the title of the membership, with easy to read text.

Credit System: The credit system will be displayed in a clear and simple box with the text information and the specific value below it.

Point System: The point system will be displayed in a clear and simple box with the text information and the specific use of the point system below it.

Color Scheme: The infographic will use the brand's color palette, with Electric Teal used to highlight important text and numbers. All other text will be in Light Silver against a dark background.
